<media:description>[English Translation] “Way back before I came to know my status I used to be a heavy drinker of alcohol. I started to experience health problems in 1987. I still continued drinking beer (Mosi & Castle) and smoking. Whenever I drank I used to have problems – headache and fever, especially at night. The problem became more serious especially after I was found with TB in 1993. The doctor advised me to cut down on smoking and drinking while I was on treatment. But it was not easy, the first step I took was to try to stop smoking. After 8 months of TB treatment I recovered fully but still I used to drink some beer, all my friends were beer drinkers. Most of the time I was with them I found myself going back to my old ways. In 1995 I had a TB relapse and this time it was severe. You can say you won’t go back to drink but your friends will influence you. You can tell them your health will not allow you to drink. They will respond that this is rubbish, that drinking has nothing to do with your health. In my situation everything was not okay, we had hunger at home and I was ill. There was little money and it had to go for food and medicine and you found yourself drinking it off with friends. It was just last year, 2004, after the death of my wife that I started to see some symptoms. Body pains continuously. I used to go to the clinic but was just being given panadol. This time every time I drank I fell very sick – I was experiencing night sweat and fever, flu and abdominal pains. It was not until my wife died that I took an HIV test. I knew it all along but I just wasn’t ready to face the truth. After the test the doctor advised me to minimize drinking and smoking. To work on my diet. I decided to stop both there and then. From this time my flu and night sweat has disappeared. There are no longer illnesses I can’t account for. It was only when I knew my status that I finally decided to give up alcohol. I knew if I did drink I could die. I knew how dangerous it was. Never again – I’ll never go back.” [Credits] This testimony was granted in 2005 to the Positive Living Handbook (page 37) and recorded in 2018 as a test of this new podcast by Zambia Peace Corps Volunteer Adam Greenberg, Rural Aquaculture Promotion.

  <media:description>[English Translation] “Our football team is about 16 members including women. Through playing football we get to mingle together and feel alive. And exercise is good for the group. We have started to play other support groups – and as we get better, we’re winning! I think taking part in sport helps you to be open about your status. It encourages you to get out and be active. This way we can show others what living positively is all about.” [Credits] This testimony was granted in 2005 to the Positive Living Handbook (page 33) and recorded in 2019 by Zambia Peace Corps Volunteer Adam Greenberg, Rural Aquaculture Promotion.

  <media:description>[English Translation] “One of my close friends was unwell with an STI (sexually transmitted infection). Our Clinical Officer here in Kapiri advised him to go for VCT (voluntary counseling and testing). I didn’t want him to be on his own so I offered to go with him for support. We both had the test done, he tested HIV negative and I tested HIV positive. The news came as a huge blow to me, it was the last thing I was expecting, he was the one who was ill not me. I’m married with two young daughters and after I first found out the news I couldn’t tell my wife. I realized if I wanted to protect her I had to use condoms. Though I tried I couldn’t sleep with her, I lost my sex drive and avoided her. My counselor encouraged me to open up to her. I did and I went with her for VCT, she also tested HIV positive. For one month she was not herself but slowly she began to accept her status. I’d already been involved in the local NZP+ group and she joined me. She helped mobilize a support group on her own and now has become a very strong member of NZP+, also doing psycho-social counseling. I feel we have become a stronger family now I know I can handle the fact I am HIV positive – my wife is more than able to. My CD4 count was very low, though I have never been ill, and I went onto ARV drugs at the recommendation of the clinic. I have had no serious side effects from the drugs and my sex drive has returned. I’m not sure whether this is because I feel psychologically ok again or because I’m on the ARV drugs. I now feel it’s important for me to support others locally who are living with HIV. There are still many woh are scared to come to the clinic. They are stigmatising themselves. I hope if they see me and I can speak to them this might give them encouragement. Coming together with others who are in the same situation as yourself really helps to build your confidence, you have time to ask questions and find out more about what living with HIV involves.” [Credits] This testimony was granted in 2005 to the Positive Living Handbook (page 16) and recorded in 2019 by Zambia Peace Corps Volunteer Adam Greenberg, Rural Aquaculture Promotion.
